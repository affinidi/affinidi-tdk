# Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK)

The Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK) is a modern interface that allows you to easily manage and integrate Affinidi services into your application. It minimises dependencies and enables developers seamless entry into the [Affinidi Trust Network (ATN)](https://www.affinidi.com/get-started).

## Building the TDK

### Requirements

- [NodeJs v18 or higher](https://nodejs.org)
- Supported platforms
  - Linux
  - MacOS
  - Windows

### Building from Source

To build the TDK clients, run the command:

`npm run build`

The client information is generated in the [clients](clients) directory.

### Create Sample Project

To create a sample project for a package or library, run the command

`npm run create:sample`

## How do I use Affinidi TDK?

The Affinidi TDK provides [clients](clients) with endpoints as methods to access Affinidi services like KYC, IAM, Wallet, and VPA, among others.

The [packages](packages) are commonly used utilities to perform actions. For example, the `auth-provider` package can fetch the _project-scoped_ token and passed to the client to access the endpoints. You can check the sample usage [here](clients/client-aca/README.md#L47).

[Libraries](libs) provide high-level abstractions that combine logic and data to perform necessary business logic functionalities.

You can check out the README for any particular [client](clients) for sample usage, including the packages and libraries, and to understand how to integrate it into your application.
