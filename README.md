<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-BADGE:END -->

The Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK) is a modern interface that allows you to easily manage and integrate [Affinidi Elements](https://www.affinidi.com/product/affinidi-elements) and [Frameworks](https://www.affinidi.com/developer#lota-framework) into your application. It minimises dependencies and enables developers to integrate seamlessly into the [Affinidi Trust Network (ATN)](https://www.affinidi.com/get-started).

## How do I use Affinidi TDK?

The Affinidi TDK provides three types of modules:

- [Clients](clients), which offer methods to access Affinidi Elements services like Credential Issuance, Credential Verification, and Login Configurations, among others.
- [Packages](packages), which are commonly used utilities/helpers that are self-contained and composable.
- [Libraries](libs), which are high-level abstractions that combine logic and data to perform necessary business logic functionalities.

## Requirements

To use the Affinidi TDK, you must have the recommended version of the supported programming language.

| TypeScript           | Python             | Dart             | PHP             | Java             |
