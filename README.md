# Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK)

The Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK) is a modern interface that allows you to easily manage and integrate Affinidi services into your application. It minimises dependencies and enables developers seamless entry into the [Affinidi Trust Network (ATN)](https://www.affinidi.com/get-started).

## How do I use Affinidi TDK?

The Affinidi TDK provides three type of modules:

- [Clients](clients), which offer methods to access Affinidi services like IAM, Verifier, Orgnaizational Wallet, and Login configuation, among others.

- [Libraries](libs), which provide high-level abstractions that combine logic and data to perform necessary business logic functionalities.

- [Packages](packages), which are commonly used utilities/helpers that are self-contained and composable.

Each module has its own README that you can check to better understand how to integrate it into your application.

## Available modules

The Affinidi TDK offers the following modules and programming languages:
